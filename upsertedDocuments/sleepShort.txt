 The path to a really great night's sleep starts in the morning. Wake up if you want to be alert, get as much bright light in your eyes as you can, but ideally sunlight. It sets in motion a big increase in cortisol, but it's a healthy increase that leads to alertness. Triggers an increase in body temperature, which is important for waking up. And it sets a timer on melatonin release so that about 16 hours later, your melatonin levels are gonna go up. You do that most days. If you miss a day, no big deal. If you miss two days, you're starting to drift. And when I say drift, I mean that these neurochemical systems are gonna start to get out of sync with the daylight cycle. That morning light pulse is, I say light pulse, light viewing is immensely important. A drift in cortisol peak toward the later day is a signature of depression and waking up at three, four in the morning and not being able to fall back asleep. Signature of depression. A drift in cortisol peak. So you'll get that drift if you don't get that light exposure early in the morning. That's right. You're gonna get a big increase in cortisol at some point every 24 hours. You want that to be early in the day and when you want to be alert.
